# Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000-2011
#### ðŸš€ Exited to share myfirst Power Bi Dashboard on GitHub! This repository is dedicated to Bird Strikes between 2000-2011 analysis.
Domain : Transportation and Communication
<br><br>
Transport and communication are in the crucial domain in the field of analytics.Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas.These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people. Seeking new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope with and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.

      A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones, are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in several fatal accidents.
     <br> <br>
      Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels.
